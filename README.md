<h1>Hi there reviewer and welcome to my documentation of my todo app!</h1>

    <h1>What does it do?</h1>
    The application is built so you can add tasks to your list so you don't have to remember it all the time by yourself.<br>
    You also can delete tasks if you think your list is full or you have tasks already done.

    <h1> thank you for your time</h1>
